# AI, between hype and history
The following blog post is documentation of what I learned from reading the article called “AI as normal technology” and how it shifted my perspective.

The article presents the argument that AI is no more extraordinary than other technological innovations from the past. Just as electricity started with lighting but later transformed manufacturing and communication, AI started with chatbots but might eventually reshape how jobs with a lot of mental load are performed. But we are not there yet. It criticises how AI adoption is measured and that the time it takes for diffusion and application to happen, are being underestimated. Understanding the trend of technology is not just a matter of being right or wrong, it's about finding the right policies to govern such technological innovations the right way and thus enabling application where useful.

Looking at technology innovation from a short run and long run perspective can be helpful because it is tempting to overestimate the impact of such innovation in the short run and underestimate the impact it will have in the long run.

## The short run
My first learning stems from the very telling example the article provides about machine learning and the methods being used. Despite the invention of new approaches for statistical models applications still rely on old and proven methods. This is because newer methods are more uncontrolled and yield unexpected results which are difficult to detect beforehand thus creating unwanted outcomes.
This example touches on the problem that we do not trust AI results. For example LLMs struggle to give factually correct results. While approaches like reflection have shown to improve results they are not reliable enough. Other approaches like Neural Symbol Systems try to capture knowledge within AI but these worlds seem notoriously difficult to combine. A paper from Apple which went viral this year called "The Illusion of Thinking" suggests that Large Reasoning Models fail to genuinely reason on complex tasks. In their experiments they noticed that the model does not come to new conclusions even if it has the computational resources to do so. This does seem to be a crucial problem which needs to be solved for broader application for tasks that are currently being performed by humans.

This lack of reliability is compounded by the fact that AI tasks are rarely uniform across industries. Tasks that look similar from afar often hide very different complexities. An example for this is collecting data. This might involve scanning and understanding documents to build a large database in one industry and doing interviews with people for a different industry. It is tempting to think of a task as simple to automate from the outside, but the hidden details only come to light when inspected more thoroughly.

I now understand that it is difficult to see the next hurdles we will be facing and therefore we should be cautious not to overstate the technology's potential in the short run. It is only reasonable to assume that AI will only be an augmentation of human work rather than the replacement.

## The long run
The short run challenges do not contradict the long run promise. In fact, they are part of the same pattern every major technology has followed.
 
While other technologies such as the internet have changed the way we work but took multiple decades to do so, the AI hype in LLMs has the special attributes that it is the first time technology has not just enabled better thinking but actually augmented the thinking process itself.
For example the internet made it possible to access knowledge in much larger quantities, from very diverse sources and with real time updates but in the end it had to be the humans piecing the information chunks together. Because language comes naturally to us, LLMs don’t just provide information but augment our thought process. This not only makes the technology accessible to many people but it also spans all industries and facets of life. This technology could accelerate its own development which is something that we have not yet seen before in technologies.

It’s tempting to think AI is magical, but in reality it’s just the next step in a long line of technologies that took decades to show their true value. Therefore I find it reasonable to argue that AI is normal technology. It seems to have a unique set of challenges in the short run and the hype around it is hiding the actual diffusion. But it bears huge potential in the long run. There is no point in fostering fear and calculating the probabilities of unlikely events but an opportunity to tackle many seemingly unsolvable problems.
